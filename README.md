## Data

The dataset utilized for this classification task is sourced from **Kaggle's dog breed identification competition**.

The dataset can be accessed at: [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification/data](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification/data)

## 🖼️ Sample Images

Images were structured in a `train/` and `test/` directory with subfolders per breed:


data/
train/
labrador/
poodle/
husky/
...

> *Image size: 224x224 — chosen for balance between detail and speed.*

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis

- Number of classes (dog breeds): **X**
- Total images: **XXXX**
- Verified balanced class distribution with `class_names` from TensorFlow.

```python
train_data = tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory("path/train", image_size=(224, 224))
```

## 🧱 Model Architecture

base_model = tf.keras.applications.EfficientNetB0(include_top=False)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    base_model,
    tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

• Transfer learning with frozen base for initial training
